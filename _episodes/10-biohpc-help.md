To ensure that we can assist you as efficiently as possible, please answer some or all of the following questions.

1. **What is the problem?** What were you trying to do? What happened instead?
Provide any error messages, debug logs, and/or diagnostic output that you have. Any insight you have into what the possible causes 
and factors are would be helpful as well.

2. **When and where did it happen?**
What time did it occur? Which folder(s) were you in and using? Were you using a cluster node or a client/workstation? 
If using a node, which one? If the problem arose from a scheduled job or visualization session, what was the job ID? 
Were you on campus or off campus with VPN? Were you using wired connection or Wi-Fi when accessing BioHPC services? What is your IP address?

3. **How did you run it?**
What program or software did you run? Which parameters and settings did you use, and what were their values? Are these the defaults, or have you tweaked the values?

4. **Any unusual circumstances?**
Have you compiled your own software? Do you customize shell startup scripts such as bashrc? Do you customize program startup? 
Are you using an environment that has worked in the past, or are you trying something new?

5. **Can we look at your scripts and data, or access your user account?**
Depending on the problem and its complexity, we may need to access your files and account. 
We require your affirmative, written permission to access these. Prior to us accessing your data, please let us know if there is any sensitive data or PHI. 
If possible, please let us know the exact, absolute paths to the scripts and data in question.
