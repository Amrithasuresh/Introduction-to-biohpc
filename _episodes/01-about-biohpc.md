### Overview

The UT Southwestern BioHPC team provides and maintains high-performance computing, storage and client systems for the UTSW research community. BioHPC offers hardware for cluster computing, large data storage, file sharing inside and outside the campus, and a portal to integrated desktop and thin-client computing in individual labs. These offerings are now made available to users across campus, both in the basic sciences and the clinical arenas.

The BioHPC Business Plan summarizes how academic and clinical teams may interact with this infrastructure, including details about the process of gaining membership to the BioHPC.
